multi threading

JDK----->compiler(byte code)

JVM----->executor(machine code)

compiler
--------
Javac Test.java

executor(JVM will create process here onwards only)
--------
Java Test


1.process will created
2.JVM instance is allocated for process------------->Interpreter/JIT Compiler --------------->convert byte code to machine code


NOTE:- 

1.in multi threading, we are focusing on JVM only

2.JVM will create process

Hierachy
--------

CPU->JVM->PROCESS->THREADS

Process :- 

1.process is nothing but instace of a program that is getting excuted(Note:- excution only done by JVM only)
2.process has own resources such as memory,thread etc.os allocate resources to process when its created.

Thread :- 

1.thread is nothing but sequence of instructions set in process(threads run independent of cpu)
2.thread is light weight process
3.one process can have multiple threads
4.when process is created,it start with 1 thread and that initial thread is 'main thread' from that we can create multiple
  threads to perform task concurrently.


How much memory does process gets??
---------------------------------

java -Xms512m -Xmx2g MainClassName

NOTE:-
----
1.there is no context switching between thread pool threads
2.there is a context switching between user defined threads
3.each task taking one thread from thread pool to process the task,after process the task then again release back to thread pool
4.completeable future submit tasks to thread pool threads 


JVM(heap,stack,code segment,data segment,registers,program counters)

IMP
---

1.Heap,Code segment,Data segment common for all register,stacks,program counter and threads


2.Register ,stacks,program counters specific to thread only


COMPILE TIME
------------

Bytecode

RUN TIME
--------

1.Process
2.Jvm instace
3.Interpreter/JIT Compiler
4.machine code

QUESTIONS
---------
1.who decide how much over all heap memory allocated for jvm?
2.who decide whatever heap memory we have that is allocated to process?

CODE SEGMENT
------------
1.it contains machine code of the java program
2.machine code is generate after execution of bytecode
3.read only
4.all threads with in the same process,share the same code segment.

DATA SEGMENT
------------
1.contains the GLOBAL and STATIC variables(whatever global variable in code segment).
2.all threads with in the same process,share the same data segment.
3.Threads can read and modify the same data.
4.synchronization is required between multiple threads
      ->if synchronization not there,then data is not consistent.
      ->if synchronization not there,then multiple threads use data segment so data is not consistent.


HEAP
----
1.Objects created at runtime using "new" keyword are allocated in the heap.
  	->threads internall create new objects that is allocated memory in the heap
2.Heap is shared among all the threads of the same process(but not with in process)
	->let say in process1,x8000 heap memory pointing to same location in 
	  physical memory,same x8000 point to different locat‭ion for process2)
3.Threads can read and modify the heap data.
4.synchronization is required between multiple threads.

STACK
-----
1.each thread has its own stack.
2.it manages,method calls,local variables.

REGISTER
--------
1.when JIT(just in time compiles converts the Bytecode into native machine code
  ->it uses register to optimized the generated machine code.
2.Also helps in context switching.
3.each thread has its own register.

COUNTER
-------
1.Also known as Program Counter,it points to the address location of instruction(particular thread) which is getting executed from CODE SEGEMENT.
2.Increments its counter after successfully execution of the instruction.

Execution order
---------------
Code segment->Counter->Thread

NOTE:- All these are managed by JVM



OS schedules(also JVM schedulers) or manages the thread
-------------------------------------------------------

os schedules thread for execution then that is shared to cpu
(in between cpu register and thread register ,there context switching is happening)


SCENARIOS
---------

CPU Cores 2 , Threads 4---------->in this case context switching is need

CPU Cores 2 , Threads 2---------->in this case context switching is no need

CPU Cores 4 , Threads 2---------->in this case context switching is no need

CONTEXT SWITCH TIME
-------------------
CPU and Register take key role

Multi tasking vs Multi threading
--------------------------------

Process 1 and Process 2------------->multi tasking

Thread 1 ,Thread 2 and Thread 3(All threads are in Process 1 only)---------->multi threading

NOTE:-

1.multi tasking do not share the resource
2.multi threading share the resource



Multi threading
---------------
1.allows a program to perform multiple tasks or operation at the same time
2.multiple threads share the same resource such as memory space but still can
  perform task independently

Benefits
--------
1.improved performance by task parallelism
2.Responsiveness
3.Resource sharing

Challenges
----------
1.Concurrency issue like deadlock,data inconsistency etc.
2.Synchronized overhead.
3.Testing and Debugging is difficult.

why we have 2 ways to create threads
------------------------------------

1.class extend only 1 class

2.class implements more than 1 class


runnable interface execution
----------------------------
1.first call run method of thread class
2.internally thread class checks (target!=null) 
  then call the run method of runnable interface implemented class method that is run method


NOTE:-
1.IT industry uses runnable interface 

Thread class execution
----------------------
1.here directly calling the override method in sub class of Thread class

NOTE:-

1.if provided override method in sub class of thread then not involved Thread class run method
2.if not provided override method in sub class of thread then involved default Thread class run method



IMPORTANT POINTS
----------------

runnable interface(not override run method)

thread class(override run method)


Runnable interface------->there is target(concreate class)

Thread class------------>there is no target




Runnable interface----------->We are calling run method on thread class then internally calling concreate class
                              (here concreate class is called as target)

Thread class------------>We are calling run method on concreate class



states(new,runnable,terminated,blocked,waiting,timed waiting)
------
runnable state---------------->(runnable and running)
--------------

not state(running)
---------


new-------->creation

runnable-------->start

runnable-------->start (runnable and running both are different)

blocked--------->file or db operations

waiting-------->wait() and notify()

timed waiting------>Thread.sleep(1000) and join()

stop or teriminate(both are same)



Blocked(file or db operations)------------>Release monitor logs

Waiting------------->Release monitor logs

Timed Waiting(Thread.sleep(1000))------->Do not release monitor logs



start--------->keep it in runnable state(runnable---->waiting for cpu)


runnable(waiting for cpu)-------------->Blocked,Waiting,Timed Waiting

running(got the cpu)


new
---
1.Thread has been created but not started
2.its just an object in memory

runnable
--------
1.Thread is ready to run
2.waiting for cpu time

running
-------
1.when thread start executing its code

blocked
-------
Different scenarios where runnable thread goes into the blocking state
1.i/o:- like reading from file or database
2.lock acquired:- if thread want to lock on a resource which is locked by other thread,it has to wait.
NOTE:- Releases all the MONITOR LOCKS

Waiting
-------
1.Thread goes into this state when we call the wait() method,makes it non-runnable
2.it goes back to runnable,once we call notify() or notifyAll() method
NOTE:- Releases all the MONITOR LOCKS

Timed waiting
-------------
1.Thread waits for specific period of time and comes back to runnable state,after specific conditions met. like sleep() and join()

NOTE:- Do not Releases any MONITOR LOCKS

Terminated
----------
1.life thread is completed ,it can not be started back again.


Implicit locking
----------------

Class or Object level and method level Monitor lock
---------------------------------------------------

Method level Monitor lock
-------------------------
1.synchronized(With single object or multiple objects)

Note:- 
1.each object has own monitor lock
2.each object monitor lock not shared in between the objects


Class or Object level Monitor lock
----------------------------------
1.static with synchronized(used in method signature)

Explicit locking
----------------
1.ReentrantLock

2.ReadWriteLock

3.StampedLock

Note:- 

1.locks,notify(),wait() working on object created whatever shared resource(synchronized)
2.whatever thread is waiting on shared resource that is notified by notify()
3.user wants to wait for the access of shared resource by thread by using wait()

flow of thread class
--------------------

ONE WAY
-------

1.Thread class object creation-->run method of runnable implemented class-->shared resource created by synchronized

SECOND WAY
-----------
1.class that is extends by Thread class that contains run method--------->shared resource created by synchronized





Monitor lock on-------------->runnable state


Monitor locks------------>using synchronized method or block


Note:- monitor locks priorty for synchronized method or block assuming same

Example:1
---------

public classs MonitorLockExample{

	public synchronized void task1(){
             //do something
             try{
                 System.out.println("inside task1");
                 Thread.sleep(10000);
             } 
             catch(Exception e){
                //exception handling here
             }
        }
        

        public void task2(){
            System.out.println("task2 , but before synchronized");
            synchronized(this){
                 System.out.println("task2, inside synchronized");
            }
       }
      
     
       public void task3(){

          t1.start();
          t2.start();
          t3.start();
   }
}


Example:2
---------

            }
       }
      
     
       public void task3(){
            System.out.println("task3");
       }
}


public class MonitorThread1Runnable implements Runnable{

    MonitorLockExample obj;

    MonitorThread1Runnable(MonitorLockExample obj){
         this.obj=obj;
    }

    @Override

}

NOTE:-at a time only 1(no matter of method or block)

NOTE:- run method internally calling critical section using synchronized method or block

Example:3
---------

public class SharedResource{

    boolean itemAvailable=false;

Assignment:Producer and consumer problem

Question:
---------

Two threads,a producer and a consumer,share a common, fixed-size buffer as a queue.
the producer's job is to generate data and put it into the buffer,
while the consumer's job is to consume the data from the buffer.
the problem is to make sure that the producer won't produce data if  the 
buffer is full, and the consumer won't consume data if the buffer is empty.


public class SharedResource {
    private Queue<Integer> sharedBuffer;
    private int bufferSize;

    public SharedResource(int bufferSize){
        sharedBuffer=new LinkedList<>();
        this.bufferSize=bufferSize;
    }

    public synchronized void produce(int item) throws  Exception{
        //If Buffer is full,wait for the consumer to consume items
        while (sharedBuffer.size()==bufferSize){
            System.out.println("Buffer is full,Producer is waiting for consumer");
            wait();
        }
        sharedBuffer.add(item);
        System.out.println("Produced:"+item);
        //Notify the consumer that there are items to consume now
        notify();
    }

    public synchronized int consume() throws Exception{
        //Buffer is empty,wait for the producer to produce items
        while(sharedBuffer.isEmpty()){
            System.out.println("Buffer is empty,Consumer is waiting for producer");
            wait();
        }
        int item=sharedBuffer.poll();
        System.out.println("Consumed:"+item);
        //Notify the producer that there is space in the buffer now
        notify();
        return item;
    }
}


public class ProducerConsumerLearning {

    public static void main(String args[]){
        SharedResource sharedBuffer=new SharedResource();

        Thread producerThread=new Thread(()->{
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
                sharedBuffer.produce(i);
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                //handle exception here
            }
        });

        Thread consumerThread = new Thread(() -> {
            try {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
                    sharedBuffer.consume();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                //handle exception here
            }
        });
        producerThread.start();
        consumerThread.start();
    }
}



Why Stop,Resume,Suspended method is deprecated?
-----------------------------------------------


STOP :  Terminates the thread abruptly,No lock release,No resource clean up happens.

Suspend : Put the Thread on hold(Suspend) for temporarily.No lock is release too.

RESUME : Used to Resume the executio of suspended thread.

Both this operation could led to issues like deadlock.

lets see an example of it


public class SharedResource{

	boolean isAvailable=false;
	
	public synchronized void produce(){
	
	    System.out.println("Lock  acquired");
		isAvailable=true;
		try{
		    Thread.sleep(8000);
		}
		catch(Exception e){
			//handle some exception here
		}
		System.out.println("Lock release");
	}
}


public class Main{

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
	    SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();
		System.out.println("Main thread started");
		
		Thread th1=new Thread(()->{
			System.out.println("Thread1 calling produce method");
			resource.produce();
		});
		
		Thread th2=new Thread(()->{
			try{
				Thread.sleep(1000);
			}
			catch(Exception e){
			}
			System.out.println("Thread2 calling produce method");
			resource.produce();
		});
		
		th1.start();
		th2.start();
		
		try{
			Thread.sleep(3000);
		}
		catch(Exception e){
		}
			
			
		System.out.println("Thread1 is suspended");
		th1.suspend();
		
		try{
			Thread.sleep(3000);
		}
		catch(Exception e){
		}
			
		th1.resume();
		System.out.println("Main thread is finishing its work");
	}
}



Monitor locks releases
----------------------

1.blocked(making db calls time)

2.waiting(wait())

Monitor locks not releases
--------------------------

3.timed waiting(Thread.sleep(5000))

join()
------

1.in threads,whenever join() applied on the object then that thread execute first.

2.remaining threads holding the execution.

JOIN:
-----

--When JOIN method is invoked on a thread object.Current thread will be
  blocked and waits for the specific thread to finish.

--It is helpful when we want to coordinate between threads or to ensure 
  we complete certain task before moving ahead.

Thread priority:- it is just hint but not gurrantee to follow the order



Thread Priority
---------------

-Priorities are integer ranging from 1 to 10

1->low priority

10->highest priority

-Even we set the thread priority while creation,its not gurantted to follow any
 specific order,its just a hint to thread scheduler which to execute next.(but its not strict rule)
 
 -When new thread is created,it inherit the priority of its parent thread.
 
 -we can set custom priority using "setPriority(int priority)" method

		catch(Exception e){
		}
	
		System.out.println("Main thread is finishing its work");
	}
}


Daemon thread:- it is supporting thread such as garbage collector in java,auto save of intellij editor,logging etc



public class SharedResource{

	boolean isAvailable=false;
	
	public synchronized void produce(){
	
	    System.out.println("Lock  acquired");
		isAvailable=true;
		try{
		    Thread.sleep(8000);
		}
		catch(Exception e){
			//handle some exception here
		}
		System.out.println("Lock release");
	}
}


public class Main{

	public static void main(String args[])
	{
	    SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();
		
		System.out.println("Main thread started");
		
		Thread th1=new Thread(()->{
			System.out.println("Thread1 calling produce method");
			resource.produce();
		});
		
		
		th1.setDaemon(true);
		th1.start();
	
		System.out.println("Main thread is finishing its work");
	}
}



Daemon thread vs user thread
----------------------------

1.Daemon thread uses setter method that used to set flag then only act as Daemon thread

2.User thread not uses setter method that is called user thread



Locks and Semaphores
--------------------

locks do not depend on object like synchronize method


system design

db locks


locks

1.ReentrantLock(same or different object allow at a time only one)
---------------

case 1:- with same object

public class SharedResource{

    boolean isAvailable=false;
    ReentrantLock lock=new ReentrantLock();
    

    public void producer(){
        try{
               lock=lock();
               System.out.println("lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               isAvailable=true;
               Thread.sleep(4000);
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.unlock();
                 System.out.printl("Lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }
}


public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){

         SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();             //with same object

         Thread th1=new Thread(()->{
              resource.producer();
         });

         Thread th2=new Thread(()->{
              resource.producer();
          });
          th1.start();
          th2.start();
     }
}




case 2:- different object

public class SharedResource{

    boolean isAvailable=false;
    

    public void producer(ReentrantLock lock){
        try{
               lock=lock();
               System.out.println("lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               isAvailable=true;
               Thread.sleep(4000);
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.unlock();
                 System.out.printl("Lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }
}


public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){

	 ReentrantLock lock=new ReentrantLock(); 

         SharedResource resource1=new SharedResource();         //with different object

         Thread th1=new Thread(()->{
              resource1.producer(lock);
         });

         SharedResource resource2=new SharedResource();        //with different object

         Thread th2=new Thread(()->{
              resource2.producer(lock);
          });

          th1.start();
          th2.start();
     }
}



ReadWriteLock
-------------

ReadLock(shared lock):- more than 1 thread can acquire the read lock.

WriteLock(exclusive lock):- only 1 thread can acquire the write lock.


IMPORTANT
---------

Read High(1000 times) and Write Low(10 times)


public class SharedResource{

    boolean isAvailable=false;
    

    public void producer(ReadWriteLock lock){
        try{
               lock.readLock().lock();
               System.out.println("Read lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               Thread.sleep(4000);
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.readLock().unlock();
                 System.out.printl("Read lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }


    public void coonsumer(ReadWriteLock lock){
        try{
               lock.writeLock().lock();
               System.out.println("write lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               isAvailable=true;
               Thread.sleep(4000);
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.writeLock().unlock();
                 System.out.printl("Write lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }
}



public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){ 

         SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();         
         ReadWriteLock lock=new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

         Thread th1=new Thread(()->{
              resource.producer(lock);
         });

         Thread th2=new Thread(()->{
              resource.producer(lock);
         });

         SharedResource resource1=new SharedResource();        

         Thread th3=new Thread(()->{
              resource1.consume(lock);
          });

          th1.start();
          th2.start();
          th3.start();
     }
}



StampedLock(Read/Write Lock ,Optimistic Read)
-----------

1.Support Read/Write Lock functionality like ReadWriteLock


types of locks

1.pessimistic locks(synchronized,ReentrantLock,ReadWriteLock(shared/exclusive locks))
2.optimistic locks(no lock acquired)

1.pessimistic locks
-------------------

public class SharedResource{

    boolean isAvailable=false;

    StampedLock lock=new StampedLock();
    

    public void producer(){
        long stamp=lock.readLock();

        try{
               System.out.println("Read lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               isAvailable=true;
               Thread.sleep(4000);
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.unlockRead(stamp);
                 System.out.printl("Read lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }


    public void coonsumer(){

        long stamp=lock.writeLock();

        try{
               System.out.println("write lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
               isAvailable=false;
            }
            catch(Exception e){

            }
            finally{
                 lock.unlockWrite(stamp);
                 System.out.printl("Write lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            }
    }
}


public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){ 

         SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();         
        
         Thread th1=new Thread(()->{

          });

          th1.start();
          th2.start();
          th3.start();
     }
}


2.optimistic locks(it works on the DB)

public class SharedResource{
  int a=10;
  StampedLock lock=new StampedLock();
  public void producer(){
      long stamp=lock.tryOptimisticRead();
      try{
          System.out.println("Taken optimistic lock");
          a=11;
          Thread.sleep(6000);
          if(lock.validate(stamp)){
              System.out.println("updated a value successfully");
           }
           else {
               System.out.println("rollback of work");
               a=10;//rollback
           }
       }
       catch(Exception e){
       }
    }


     public void consumer(){

          long stamp=lock.writeLock();
          System.out.println("Write lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
   
          try{
             System.out.println("performing work");
             a=9;
          }
           finally{
              locks.unlockWrite(stamp);
              System.out.println("Write lock released by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
          }
     }
}


public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){

          });

          th1.start();
          th2.start();
     }
}


Semaphore Lock
--------------

public class SharedResource{

   boolean isAvailable=false;
  
   Semaphore lock=new Semaphore(2);

   public void producer(){
       
       try{
            lock.acquire();
            System.out.println("Lock acquired by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
            isAvailable=true;
            Thread.sleep(4000);
       }
       catch(Exception e){

       }
       finally{
             lock.release();
             System.out.println("Lock release by:"+Thread.currentThread().getName());
       }

}



public class Main{

     public static void Main(String args[]){ 

         SharedResource resource=new SharedResource();         
        
         Thread th1=new Thread(()->{

          th2.start();
          th3.start();
          th4.start();
     }
}



synchronized(monitor lock----------->wait and notify)



condition
---------

await()------------>wait()

signal()----------->notify()

signalAll()-------->notifyAll()



public class SharedResource {

    boolean isAvailable=false;
    ReentrantLock lock=new ReentrantLock();
    Condition condition=lock.newCondition();

    public void producer(){
       try{

CAS(Compare And Swap-------->it works on the CPU)







Executor(I)
--------

single method in parent interface

ExecutorService(I)
---------------

multiple methods in child interface of Excutor(I)


ThreadPoolExcutor(C)
-----------------
this is the concreate class of ExecutorService(I)


public ThreadPoolExecutor(
    int corePoolSize,
    int maximumPoolSize,
    long keepAliveTime,
    TimeUnit unit,
    BlockingQueue<Runnable> workQueue,
    ThreadFactory threadFactory,
    RejectedExecutionHandler handler
)


1.user defined thread vs predefined thread using executor framework

2.user defined thread------------->not reuseable(more context switching,less processing time)

3.predefined thread using executor framework----------->reuseable(less context switching,more processing time)----------->can we use 2 cpu in single machine?
how intercommunication

4.completeablefuture async vs kafka async communication

imp
---

5.minimum thread number vs maximum thread number

6.minimum thread are busy then place in queue otherwise dont use queue(assume queue size 5 only)

7.if queue size also full then only enable maximum thread number for new task(note:-dont use maximum thread number for old task whatever in the queue)

8.if maximum thread number also full then only rejected the task 

note:- 

1.use maximum thread number after queue full

2.initially minimum thread number and queue size is the matter after that only went to maximum thread number

minimum thread number(avarage time)

queue size(peak time)

maximum thread number(rare cases if minimum thread number and queue size full)

3.keepAliveTime used when the allowCoreThreadTimeOut property set to true


IMP
---

Generally,the ThreadPool min and max size are depend on various factors

-CPU Cores
-JVM Memory
-Task Nature(CPU Intensive or I/O Intensive)
-Concurrency Requirement(Want high or medium or low
-Memory Required to process a request
-Throughput etc.


Max No of thread=No.of CPU Core * (1+Request waiting time/processing time)

Max no of active tasks=Task Arrival rate * Task execution time



Daemon thread vs user thread
----------------------------

1.Daemon thread uses setter method that used to set flag then only act as Daemon thread

2.User thread not uses setter method that is called user thread

RejectedExecutionHandler
------------------------

1.new ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy(just return error)

2.new ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy(when calling then rejected------------>but not at called side)

3.new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy(silently rejected without throwing error)

4.new ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy


life cycle of thread pool executor
----------------------------------

1.running(accepting new tasks by using submit task while thread pool executor running)
2.shutdown
----------

----->accepting existing pipeline in progress tasks but not new tasks)

----->whatever accepting existing pipeline in progress tasks but not new tasks(shutdown) after that release threads to thread pool

3.stop
------

----->force shutdown(not accepting existing pipeline in progress tasks and also new tasks)

----->whatever not accepting existing pipeline in progress tasks and also new tasks(stop) after that force shutdown and then release threads to thread pool

4.terminated
------------

terminated method used to check shutdown and stop cases threads released to thread pool executor or not
		

Blocking queue
--------------
1.array(static):- bounded queue
2.linkedlist(dynamic):- unbounded queue

ThreadFactory
-------------
1.thread name 
2.thread priority
3.thread daemon flag


Future
------
submit()

CompleteableFuture
------------------

1.supplyAsync()
2.thenApply() and thenApplyAsync()---------->no ordering
3.thenCompose() and thenComposeAsync()---------->ordering
4.thenAccept() and thenAcceptAsync()----------->end part 
5.thenCombine() and thenCombineAsync()--------->combine 2 completeable future

Submit(Runnable task)



shutdown()

awaitTermination()

shutdownNow()



schedule(Runnable command, long delay, TimeUnit unit)	Executes a one-time task after a specified delay.
schedule(Callable<V> callable, long delay, TimeUnit unit)	Schedules a Callable to execute after a delay.
scheduleAtFixedRate(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit)	Repeatedly executes the task at a fixed rate, starting after the initial delay.
scheduleWithFixedDelay(Runnable command, long initialDelay, long delay, TimeUnit unit)	Repeatedly executes the task with a fixed delay between the end of one execution and the start of the next.
shutdown()	Gracefully shuts down the executor after completing current tasks.
shutdownNow()	Attempts to stop all executing tasks immediately.
getQueue()	Returns the queue of tasks waiting to be executed.
getPoolSize()	Returns the current number of threads in the pool.
getActiveCount()	Returns the number of actively executing threads.




Executor

ThreadPoolExecutor ✅
ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor ✅
ForkJoinPool ✅   

vs

Executor executor1 = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(4);         // ThreadPoolExecutor
Executor executor2 = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();         // ThreadPoolExecutor
Executor executor3 = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();     // ThreadPoolExecutor
Executor executor4 = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(2);     // ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor
Executor executor5 = ForkJoinPool.commonPool();               // ForkJoinPool




JVM---------------->platform thread

platform thread around the os thread



Jvm wrapper for platform thread
Each Thread has Thread local class
Thread local class has Thread local variable
Here once set the value to thread local variable
Need to remove is best practice because thread local variable specific to thread but not task
Jvm is mediator between os thread and platform thread
One to mapping between platform thread and os thread
Disadvantages
1.Thread takes time for creation
2.ThreadPoolExecutor also takes time but less compared to thread
3.in thread, internally db calls that time also thread takes time
Virtual thread introduced in java 19
Virtual thread creates and managed by jvm
Whenever thread want to run that time virtual thread attached with os thread
Whenever the thread wants to wait state that time virtual thread detached with os thread
Ex: 2 os thread and many  no of virtual threads
